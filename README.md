# Cyberbullying Detection in Social Media

This repository contains all the necessary components to classify, analyze and predict instances of cyberbullying using Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to detect and classify different types of cyberbullying in social media text. We have used various machine learning models including SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes and Boosting models like XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost and advanced deep learning models (BERT) to identify patterns and predict harmful content effectively. The project also includes a summarization process to extract key insights from the detected cyberbullying cases.

## 📊 Dataset  

This contains a balanced dataset for cyberbullying detection in social media, featuring approximately **100,000 tweets** categorized into:  

- **Non-cyberbullying** – 50,000 instances  
- **Race/Ethnicity-related** – 17,000 instances  
- **Gender/Sexual-related** – 17,000 instances  
- **Religion-related** – 16,000 instances  

The dataset is designed for multi-class classification, ensuring equal representation of each class for effective model training and evaluation. [Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/momo12341234/cyberbully-detection-dataset)
