# Cyberbullying Detection in Social Media

Welcome to the **Cyberbullying Detection in Social Media** project! This repository contains all the necessary components to classify, analyze, and predict instances of cyberbullying using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project aims to detect and classify different types of cyberbullying in social media text. We have used various machine learning models, including SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Boosting models like XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, to identify patterns and predict harmful content effectively.
