# Cyberbullying Detection in Social Media

This repository contains all the necessary components to classify, analyze and predict instances of cyberbullying using Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project aims to detect and classify different types of cyberbullying in social media text. We have used various machine learning models including SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes and Boosting models like XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost and advanced deep learning models (BERT) to identify patterns and predict harmful content effectively. The project also includes a summarization process to extract key insights from the detected cyberbullying cases.
